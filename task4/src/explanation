2. Instead of running 10 times, it was run 3 times and the duration and result of each run is as follows: 

duration is 1414.03 s
sum is 1.76368e+16

duration is 1350.43 s
sum is 1.76368e+16

duration is 1456.17 s
sum is 1.76368e+16

The average duration is 1406.88 s

4. The measurement is as follows:

number of transactions per second is 319.164
the average duration of query is 1566.59 s
fork takes 0.012613 s

By comparing with result 2 and 4, we can see that in the concurrent program, the duration of query is higher, which is normal, since
so many transactions are running at the same time.
